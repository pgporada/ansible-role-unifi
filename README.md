# Overview: ansible-role-unifi
This role will set up and configure a Unifi controller. You will need to choose an appropriate role for the backend mongodb database. I choose to use my own mongodb role which can be found at [pgporada.mongodb](https://github.com/pgporada/ansible-role-mongodb). This setup is opinionated. You may not agree.
